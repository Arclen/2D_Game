# YO YO YO CHECK THIS OUT

We have a super dope team consisting of
- Jacob 
- Waqas
- Logan
- Garrett
- Jacob again

Here's our ideas (tentative):
- 2D sidescroller (not auto-scroll)
- Adaptive enemy AI
- Multiple "colors" or weapon types
  - enemies can be resistant to these types

Stuff we use:
- Slack
- Git (obviously)
- Unity
- Visual Studio `C#`
